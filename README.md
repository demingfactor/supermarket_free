## Development

### Starting the app

$ npm run start

### Building the app

$ npm run build   # will 'compile' app into the /docs directory.

### Hosting

The app is hosted on github pages, with the code configured to deploy the contents of the /docs directory. 

As the docs directory is auto-regenerated when the build command is run, for anything you want to deploy, include it in the /src directory and then rebuild the app to update it into the /docs directory.
